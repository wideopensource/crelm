# Crelm
The Crelm package provides a relatively simple API around the CFFI system. Give it C code or source files, it gives you a package with bindings to functions and `struct`s. Easiest way to get started is hack up the examples in [the repo](https://github.com/wideopensource/crelm/tree/main/examples).

### Installation

pip3 install crelm
